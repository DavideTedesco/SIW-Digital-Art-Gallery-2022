aboutus.message=Digital Art Gallery has in its database many artworks from all over the world. Those artworks are digitized by our curators and digital transformation team. The design is inspired by Mondrian's art that was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. His art, however, always remained rooted in nature.  He was a contributor to the De Stijl art movement and group, which he co-founded with Theo van Doesburg. He evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neoplasticism. This was the new 'pure plastic art' which he believed was necessary in order to create 'universal beauty'. To express this, Mondrian eventually decided to limit his formal vocabulary to the three primary colors (red, blue and yellow), the three primary values (black, white and gray) and the two primary directions (horizontal and vertical).
